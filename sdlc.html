  <h1>What is the SDLC?</h1>
    <div>The Software Development Lifecycle <em>(SDLC)</em> refers to a methodology with 
        defined processes for creating high quality software with the following phases;</div>
    <ol>
        <li>Requirement analysis</li>
        <li>Planning</li>
        <li>Software design (architecture)</li>
        <li>Software development</li>
        <li>Testing</li>
        <li>Deployment</li>
    </ol>
  <h3>1.Requirement Analysis</h3>  
    <p>What are the current problems? getting input from all stakeholders, including customers, 
       salespeople and programmers. Learn the strength and weaknesses of the current system.</p>
  <h3>2.Planning</h3>
    <p>What do we want? in this stage of the SDLC, the team determines the cost and resources
        required for implementing. It also details the risks involved and provides back up plans.<br>
       <br>The team should then determine the feasibility and how they can succesfully implement
        the project with the lowest risk in mind.</p>
  <h3>3.Design</h3>
    <p>How will we get what we want? this phase starts by turning the software specifications into
        a design plan called the Design Specification. All stakeholders then review this plan and
        offer feedback and suggestions.<br>
       <br>It's crucial to have a plan for collecting and incorporating stakeholder inout into this 
        document.
    </p>
  <h3>4.Build</h3>
    <p>At this stage, the actual development starts. It's important that you stick to the agreed
        blueprints and make sure you have proper guidelines in place about code styles and practices.</p>
  <h3>5.Code Test</h3>
    <p>Did we get what we want? at this stage, we test for defects and deficiencies. We fix those
        issues until the product meets the original specifications</p>
  <h3>6.Software Deployment</h3>
    <p>At this stage, the goal is to deploy the software to the production environment so users can 
        start using the product. However, different organisations have different procedures for moving
        the product through different deployment environments.<br>
       <br>This allows the stakeholders to safely play with the final product before releasing it to
        the market. This also allows for any mistakes to be caught before the final release.</p>

  <h1>Agile SDLC</h1>

    <p>Agile SDLC focuses on collaborative decision-making and development over multiple <strong>sprints</strong>.
        The fountaion of an Agile SDLC is a software development process in iterations instead of all at once. 
        Developers are able to focus on the most impotant features at any given moment.</p>
    <div>The Agile model has a number of advantages over traditional development including;</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Faster implementation of changes</li>
        <li>More flexibility of changes</li>
        <li>Better communication with users and greater user satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>An Agile model also allows companies to adapt to changes more quickly and can implement user-requested changes more quickly.</div>
    <p>In an Agile model environment, the project team consults stakeholders, or those that have interest
        in the project, earlier in the process. They are much more satisfied as the project team provides them
         with new functionality that satisfies their expectations on a regular basis. In addition, the project team,
         including developers and testers, build better relationships with customers as they are in constant
         contact with them.</p>
